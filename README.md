# **Retail Analytics Chatbot**

This project is a dynamic customer support chatbot designed to handle queries related to retail analytics, providing users with data-driven insights about sales, products, and more. The chatbot interacts with users via a frontend interface, processes their messages through a Flask-based backend, and responds with relevant data from an SQLite database. The bot also uses **ChatGPT-2** to generate human-like responses to enhance the user experience.

## **Project Overview**

The **Retail Analytics Chatbot** is built to facilitate customer interactions by retrieving sales and product information from an SQLite database. It serves as a real-time assistant, responding to user queries about retail analytics and combining responses from a structured database with the conversational abilities of **ChatGPT-2**. The chatbot allows users to interact in a natural language interface, providing insights and answers in an engaging, professional manner.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: SQLite (for storing sales, product, and customer data)
- **LLM Integration**: ChatGPT-2 (for natural language processing)
- **API Communication**: RESTful API (for handling user messages and sending responses)

## **Prerequisites**
Before running this project, ensure that the following dependencies are installed:
- **Python 3.x** (For the Flask application)
- **Flask** (Install via `pip install flask`)
- **SQLite3** (Built-in with Python, no external installation needed)
- **ChatGPT-2** or another LLM (Integration for natural language responses)

## **Installation Steps**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AGALYA-R/AGALYA_R_Customer-Support-Chatbot-for-Retail-Analytics
   cd retail-analytics-chatbot
   ```

2. **Set up the Backend**:
   - Navigate to the backend folder.
   - Install the required Python packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Ensure your SQLite database (`retail_data.db`) is configured properly with the necessary tables:
     - **Sales**: `(id, product_name, quantity_sold, sale_date)`
     - **Products**: `(product_id, product_name, price, category)`
     - **Customers**: `(customer_id, customer_name, email)`
     - **Queries**: `(query_id, customer_id, query_text, query_date)`

3. **Set up the Frontend**:
   - The frontend is located in the `frontend/` directory.
   - Open `index.html` to launch the chatbot interface, or serve the static files through the Flask application.

4. **Configure LLM (ChatGPT-2)**:
   - Ensure that the LLM API (ChatGPT-2) is set up for natural language query responses.
   - API keys and model configurations should be included in your backend (typically in environment variables or the `app.py`).

## **Running the Application**

1. **Start the Backend**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   This will start the Flask server on `http://localhost:5000`.

2. **Access the Frontend**:
   - Open `http://localhost:5000/` in your browser to interact with the chatbot interface.

## **Functionality**

- **Frontend**: 
   - Users type queries into a chat interface.
   - The interface sends queries to the Flask backend.
   - Chat history and user messages are displayed in the chat window.

- **Backend**:
   - Receives user queries from the frontend.
   - Processes queries, combines SQLite data responses with ChatGPT-2 generated responses, and sends them back to the user.
   - Logs chat interactions into the SQLite database for record-keeping.

- **Database**:
   - Stores sales, product, and customer information.
   - Tracks user interactions via the `Queries` table for analytics and future enhancements.

## **Future Enhancements**

- **Advanced Analytics**: Provide detailed reports on sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.
- **Extended LLM Features**: Further refine the language model's ability to handle complex and nuanced queries.
- **Data Visualization**: Integrate graphical insights into sales and customer trends directly within the chatbot interface.
- **Improved Error Handling**: Address fetch request errors and optimize response accuracy.

## **Deployment**

The chatbot is currently in a development environment. For deployment, you can consider platforms such as **Heroku**, **AWS**, or **Google Cloud**. Make sure to configure environment variables securely and update your database settings for production use.

## **Notes**
- Ensure all necessary environment variables (like API keys for ChatGPT-2 and database configurations) are set before running the project.
- This is a basic version and can be extended with more features like enhanced query handling, multi-language support, and integration with additional retail data sources.
